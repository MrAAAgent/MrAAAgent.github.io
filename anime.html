                <h3>MY TOP 10 FAVOURITE ANIME OF ALL TIME</h3>
                <h6>August 10, 2019</h6>
                <br>
                    <dt>1. Yu-Gi-Oh</dt> <dd>This was my childhood. From collecting countless cards and sending kids to the Shadow Realm, Yu-Gi-Oh has had a profound impact on my life, and I am the person that I am today due to Yu-Gi-Oh. Also, if you haven't watched it before, at least watch the Dungeon Dice Monsters mini-arc; MY FAVOURITE NON-CANNON ARC IN ANIME EVER.</dd></br>

                    <dt>2. Food Wars (Shokugeki no Soma)</dt> <dd>Food Wars from the surface looks like a fan-service filled show with zero substance. But it has the UMAMI flavour! Food Wars combines my love for food with my love for the shounen battle anime format to provide a legendary experience. Moreover, this anime's soundtrack is heavenly; I've gone through countless study sessions or last minute project grinds listening to the Food Wars soundtrack on repeat. </dd></br>
                            
                    <dt>3. Zatch Bell</dt> <dd>I don't know how this is so high up on my list. It just appeals to me. Having Mamodo fight in the human world by fighting with their fated partners to determine the next King of the Mamodo world in a battle royale just had so much potential to develop different characters and philosophies, and this anime delivered. I honestly found myself so attached to many of the side characters and when their books were burned, I bawled my eyes out TT.</dd></br>
                            
                    <dt>4. Mob Psycho 100</dt> <dd>After hearing that Mob Psycho 100 was created by the same mangaka as One Punch Man, I jumped at the chance to see some of One's other work. Little did I know, Mob Psycho capitvated me from the very beginning with an incredible                     </dd></br>
                            
                    <dt>5. Grand Blue</dt> <dd> This anime is the funniest anime I've ever watched. While the premise begins with discovering the joy of diving, the story turns into events filled with hilarity. The character dynamics between weeb boy and Iori, as well as Chisa, are just ON POINT. For a one cour anime, this is a great watch for anyone who enjoys comedy.</dd></br>
                            
                    <dt>6. Haikyuu</dt> <dd> FLY HIGH! Hinata, a short high school male is not made out for volleyball. When he joins the Karasuno High volleyball team, he meets his polar opposite Tobio Kageyama who is gifted for volleyball. This story is so motivational and my favourite sports anime of all time, despite having played at most 10 games of volleyball in my life total.</dd></br>
                            
                    <dt>7. Hunter x Hunter</dt> <dd></dd></br>
                            
                    <dt>8. Yakitate Japan</dt> <dd>This is Shokugeki no Soma all over again. Subtract the fan-service. Add the comedic puns and focus the cooking into ONLY BREAD. It's just so entertaining and the build up for each of the bread battles, all to end in a genius pun from the judges? It's just a great time. </dd></br>
                            
                    <dt>9. Silver Spoon (Gin no Saji)</dt> <dd> Silver Spoon is the epitome of a slice of life. The story followes Yuugo Hachiken, a student at the Ooezo Agricultural High School, a school for farmers. It seems like the plot for a snoozefest, but the supporting cast of characters as well as learning about the life of someone in the agricultural field results in one of the most relaxing and enjoyable anime I've watched.</dd></br>
                            
                    <dt>10. The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.</dt> <dd> While non-20 minute anime episodes tend to be some hot garbage, the 5 minute shorts of Saiki K are honestly genius. Saiki K is unrealistic in the sense of his psychic powers, but his daily life struggles are something that anyone can relate to and laugh at.</dd></br>
